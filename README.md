# online-store

This is a web project that implements a simple online shopping mall using Java and Vue.

# How to run
use `mvn tomcat7:run` to run the backend server, and use `npm run serve` to run the frontend server.

Attention: you need to run the backend server first, and then run the frontend server. Before you run the frontend server, you need to run 'npm install' to install the dependencies.
